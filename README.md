# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program provided by Forage Platform 

The British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program is a virtual internship program offered by british airways to learn and apply analytical skills to influence real-life multi million-pound decisions. The overall program consists of 2 main Tasks :
  1. Web Scraping to gain company insights : The first thing to do was to scrape review data from the web. Review Data included Reviews from the customers for the british airways flight, Rating Stars(out of 5) given by the customers, Date on which the customer took the british airways flight and Country from which the customer originates.
     After collecting the data, the next step was Data Preparation, i.e, to clean the data in order to prepare the data for analysis. The data was very messy      and contained purely text. After cleaning the data, I performed data analysis to uncover useful insights.
  2. Predicting Customer buying behaviour : After performing data analysis, the next step was to built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. Also evaluated the models performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive models power.

For both the tasks I had to summarize my findings in a single power point slide.
